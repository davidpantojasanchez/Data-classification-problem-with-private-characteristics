This article is a study of the data classification problem with private characteristics. This problem has numerous applications that are very relevant nowadays. We are going to focus on its application in the design of non-discriminatory personnel selection processes.

We will start by explaining the set cover problem, which will be useful in the study, and formally defining our problem.

A large part of the report will be devoted to the analysis of the complexity of the problem we have defined. For this purpose, we will define and verify a polynomial reduction from the set cover decision problem to the data classification problem with private characteristics.

Having proven the intractability of our problem, it is of great interest to use heuristic methods to solve in a suboptimal way the data classification problem with private characteristics. We have implemented a greedy algorithm and two genetic algorithms to solve this problem.

We will conclude the article with a case study, in which we will compare the performance of the three implemented algorithms using a non-parametric test.
