In this work we analyze the problem of, given the probability distribution of a population, questioning an unknown individual that is representative of the distribution so that our uncertainty about some of its characteristics is significantly reduced ---but the uncertainty about others, deemed private or sensitive, is not. 
This issue is crucial to extract information being relevant to some legitimate purpose while preserving the privacy of individuals. 
For instance, it is essential in the design of non-discriminatory personnel selection, promotion, and layoff processes in companies and institutions; in the retrieval of customer information being relevant to the service provided by a company (and no more); in certifications not revealing sensitive industrial information being irrelevant for the certification itself; etc. After formally defining the problem, we prove its NP-completeness. Given this intractability, we provide heuristic solutions to find reasonable solutions in polynomial time. In particular, a greedy algorithm and two genetic algorithms are presented. 
Our experiments indicate that the best results are obtained using a genetic algorithm reinforced with 
a greedy strategy.
